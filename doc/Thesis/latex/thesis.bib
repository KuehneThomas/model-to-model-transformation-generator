abstract = {Model transformation by example is a novel approach in model-driven software engineering to derive model transfor- mation rules from an initial prototypical set of interrelated source and target models, which describe critical cases of the model transformation problem in a purely declarative way. In the current paper, we automate this approach using inductive logic programming [14] which aims at the induc- tive construction of first-order clausal theories from exam- ples and background knowledge.

abstract = {In this work we investigated how robust a robot swarm acts against disturbances caused by another robot swarm, both using the BEECLUST algorithm. We show that small swarm populations can gain benefit from the presence of other robot swarms. Medium populated swarms are affected neither positively nor negatively. Large swarm populations act robust against disturbances caused by other robot swarms as long as no jamming effects occur. For our investigation we simulated an environment with an ambient illuminance, a light spot and a shadow spot. In such an environment we tested two different castes of Jasmine III robots whereas each caste had to perform a different task. One swarm aggregates at places of high illuminance (light spot), the other one at places of low illuminance (shadow spot). In this article we show that the robustness of the BEECLUST algorithm allows us to control a heterogeneous robot swarm in environments which demand differing controller strategies.},

Since the learned rules are produced directly in an actual transformation language, they can be easily tested, improved andreused.

@article{Sun2009,
abstract = {Model transformations provide a powerful capability to automate model refinements. However, the use of model transformation languages may present challenges to those who are unfamiliar with a specific transformation language. This paper presents an approach called model transformation by demonstration (MTBD), which allows an end-user to demonstrate the exact transformation desired by actually editing a source model and demonstrating the changes that evolve to a target model. An inference engine built into the un- derlying modeling tool records all editing operations and infers a transformation pattern, which can be reused in other models. The paper motivates the need for the approach and discusses the technical contributions of MTBD. A case study with several sample inferred transformations serves as a concrete example of the benefits of MTBD},

abstract = {Model transformation (MT) has become an important concern in software engineering. In addition to its role in model-driven development, it is useful in many other situations such as measurement, refactoring, and test-case generation. Roughly speaking, MT aims to derive a target model from a source model by following some rules or prin- ciples. So far, the contributions in MT have mostly relied on defining languages to express transformation rules.However, the task of defining, expressing, and maintaining these rules can be difficult, especially for proprietary and non-widely used formalisms. In some situations, companies have accu- mulated examples from past experiences. Our work starts from these observations to view the transformation prob- lem as one to solve with fragmentary knowledge, i.e. with only examples of source-to-target MTs. Our approach has two main advantages: (1) it always proposes a transforma- tion for a source model, even when rule induction is impos- sible or difficult to achieve; (2) it is independent from the source and target formalisms; aside from the examples, no extra information is needed. In this context, we propose an optimization-based approach that consists of finding in the examples combinations of transformation fragments that best cover the source model. To that end, we use two strategies based on two search-based algorithms: particle swarm opti- mization and simulated annealing. The results of validating our approach on industrial projects show that the obtained models are accurate.},
